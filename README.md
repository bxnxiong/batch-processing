## Want easy to setup data engineering projects using open source technologies?

You've found the right place! I'll continue sharing projects I find having simple enough tech stack to accomplish different use cases.

Knowing how is always first step, but it's not enough to become a great data engineer. Knowing why we make different choices is what really matters. This repo helps answer `how`, to understand `why` because the use cases are vastly different from person/team/org to person/team/org, it's beyond scope of this repo. (Maybe I can create a section for general principles guiding one to answer `why`, but for now I'll focus on the tech know-hows :)


If you like what you see, feel free to fort/star

I will list my references where I build project on top of, thanks  in advance all the folks I referenced for sharing valuable knowledge!
