## Want easy to setup data engineering projects using open source technologies?

You've found the right place! I'll continue sharing projects I find having simple enough tech stack to accomplish different use cases.

Knowing `how` is always first step, but it's not enough to become a great data engineer. Knowing `why` we make different choices is what really matters. This repo helps answer `how`, to understand `why` because the use cases are vastly different from person/team/org to person/team/org, what I put in this repo is definitely limited to the narrow use case the project solves. I'd recommend checking out all the great articles/podcasts/videos online for your specific use case

If you like what you see, feel free to fort/star

I will list my references where I build project on top of, thanks  in advance all the folks I referenced for sharing valuable knowledge!
